AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) Core Concepts

Cross-Cutting Concern → Common or duplicate code that is not part of core business logic, but is required across multiple modules.
Examples: Logging, Authentication, Authorization, Exception Handling, Transaction Management

Advice → What action you want to perform — the actual code to be executed at certain join points.
Examples: Before, After, or Around method execution.

Advice Type → Tells about the timing of execution, defined by annotation

Pointcut → Where the advice should run — defines the set of join points (methods or classes) that will be intercepted.

Aspect → A module that encapsulates both Advice and Pointcut — represents a complete cross-cutting concern.

Weaver → The tool or framework that links aspects with the main application code (weaving).
Examples: Spring AOP, AspectJ

JoinPoint → A specific point in the program execution where advice can be applied.
Examples: Method call, object creation, exception thrown, etc.

@Before -- Do something before a method is called
@After -- Do something after a method is executed irrespective if we got an exception or not.
@AfterReturning -- Do something only when a method execute successfully
@AfterThrowing -- Do something only when a method throw exception
@Around -- Do something before and after a method call
ProceedingJoinPoint -- It exposes the proceed method to support around annotation
