Encapsulation

Data Bundling: Storing state (fields) and behavior (methods) together inside a class.

Data Hiding: Using the private access modifier to restrict direct access to internal data — user should only get relevant details.

Why hide data?

To restrict unauthorized access and protect data integrity.

To make code simpler and more maintainable.

Prevents direct modifications or corruption of internal state.

If attribute names or logic change, only the class needs updates, not all its usages.

this keyword:
Refers to the current instance of a class (used to differentiate between instance and local variables).

null keyword:
A special value representing no object reference.

Primitive fields can never be null — Java auto-initializes them:

int, long → 0

boolean → false

double → 0.0

Setters:
Used for controlled assignment. We can add validations before updating values.

Constructors

Used to initialize an object when it’s created.

Rules:

Usually public (unless implementing Singleton).

No return type.

Name must match the class name.

Types:

Default / No-args constructor: Exists automatically if none is defined.

Parameterized constructor: Takes parameters for initialization.

Constructor Overloading: Multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

Basic OOP Concepts

Class: Blueprint for creating objects.

Object: Actual instance of a class.

Reference Variable: Stores the address of an object.

new keyword: Creates a new object (allocates new memory).

Static Keyword

Used to define members at the class level (shared across all instances).

Static Variable:

Belongs to the class, not the object.

Shared and reflected across all instances.

Static Method:

Belongs to the class.

Can access only static members.

POJO (Plain Old Java Object)

A simple Java class that only stores data.

Features:

Private fields (for encapsulation).

Public constructors, getters, and setters.

Mutable: Field values can change after creation.

Commonly used for data transfer, configuration, or ORM mapping (e.g., Hibernate).

Record (Java 14+)

Introduced to reduce boilerplate for data-carrying classes.

Features:

Immutable — fields cannot be modified after creation.

Automatically provides:

Constructor

Accessors (getters)

equals(), hashCode(), and toString()

Inheritance

A way of building hierarchy and passing common functionality to child classes.

Key Points:

Uses extends keyword.

1 class → 1 parent (single inheritance).

1 parent → multiple children.

Parent = superclass, child = subclass.

super keyword:

Refers to the parent class.

Used to call the parent’s constructor or methods.

If not written, Java automatically adds a call to the parent’s default constructor.

Access Rules:

private members are not inherited.

Use protected or public to allow inheritance.

Polymorphism & Type Rules:

A child object can be passed to a method expecting a parent type.

At compile time, method calls are checked via reference type (parent).

At runtime, actual method execution is decided by the object type (child).

Hence, overriding works dynamically.

Composition vs Inheritance

Inheritance:

“Is-a” relationship.

Example: Dog is an Animal.

Child extends parent → inherits functionality.

Less flexible — tightly coupled to superclass.

Composition:

“Has-a” relationship.

Example: Computer has a Motherboard, Monitor, etc.

More flexible — allows adding/removing components easily.

Enables code reuse without inheritance (via object references).
